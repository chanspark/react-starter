# Chans' react starter kit
-------------------

## Origin
I used CRA starter kit made by [ayroblu](https://github.com/ayroblu), which enable Redux, Express and SSR on react app created by CRA.  
Checkout [the original repository](https://github.com/ayroblu/ssr-create-react-app-v2). 

## Ant Design
Installed [Ant Design theme](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce) to the starter kit. In order to customize the styles, you will have to use LESS, instead of SASS. Refer to [customize theme](https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme#Less-variables) for customization.

## Install

npm install

Development Mode
